This will be a guide to complete a Kerberoasting excerise. 

REQUIRE SETUP:

This will require a full AD enviroment - Create a DC (domain controller) and join at least one workstation to the domain. Create several test user accounts for use within this activity. 

Resources for creating an enviroment can be found here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqUsy2XabJw

Now logon to a domain account on a computer joined to the domain. Download the Roaster.ps1 script and run it from this account.
